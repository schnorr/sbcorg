** The SBC in OrgMode, just type make.

Layout is from the Brazilian Computer Society (Article Style),
[[http://www.sbc.org.br/documentos-da-sbc/category/169-templates-para-artigos-e-capitulos-de-livros][available here]].

Be aware that this example is compatible with OrgMode 9.*. Earlier or
later OrgMode versions require minor modifications to the Makefile
and/or ieee.org files.

For a detailed explanation on why and how to write reproducible
articles using OrgMode, please visit the following [[https://github.com/alegrand/RR_webinars/blob/master/1_replicable_article_laboratory_notebook/index.org][page]].


*** Org-ref Instalation

Moreover, this org template uses the package =org-ref= to add and
control references instead of using latex =\cite= directly. 
To install it you must have =elpa= ou =melpa= in your emacs repositories and execute the following commands:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x package-refresh-contents
M-x package-install [enter]
bibtex-completion
M-x package-install [enter]
org-ref
M-x package-install [enter]
doi-utils
#+end_src

/*M-x is equivalent to Alt+x/

To insert a citation you can use:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
C-c ]
#+end_src

/*C-c is equivalent to Control+c/

Select the reference by typing a pattern to find or navigate using the keyboard, and when selecting the desired one, use =F2=.
Also, you can include directly in the text by using =cite:my_ref=.
